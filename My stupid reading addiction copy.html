        <p>I'd say I'm somewhat of a reading connesiuer(???) since I've read over 80 titles and was a reader since 2020. Here is a link to a spreadsheet of all the mangas, manhwas, manhuas (yes there is a difference >:( ) and webtoons that I've read.  I was originally an anime enjoyer but then my shortening attention span kicked in and now I can only read it. I've ranked all of them by my recommendation, as well as my rating from the beginning to the end, or however far I've read to.  There is also a list of like 150 more that I'm planning to read if I get to it, so I'll randomly pick one if I have time. </p>
