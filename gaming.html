                <p>I play some video games as well but I have a very peculiar taste. I only like the cute cartoon or anime-style indie games that aren't too realistic. I also dislike FPS games (valorant >O<) and horror games since I get scared easily. </p>
                <p>Here are some of the games I like. My steam account is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199245296001/">DepressedAlmond</a>, but I also have some other games as well</p>
